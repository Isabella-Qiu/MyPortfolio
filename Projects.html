          <p>Over the period of a single day and night, my team and I threw ourselves into making a website.  Together, as a team of three, our idea was to create a website to help people find the right products for their skin type, and thus, "The Right Skin" was born.  We scraped together the little HTML and CSS knowledge we had at the time to try and create this website together.  In hindsight, problems that we faced before, like creating a form, can easily be solved with the HTML and CSS knowledge we have acquired over the past few months.  And although the final product still lacks some of the features we wanted to implement, "The Right Skin" showed our great efforts in web design, but most importantly, it showed ourselves what we could do if we only pushed ourselves to learn new things.</p>

        <p>At the top, we created a navigation bar that takes the user to different parts of our one-page website.  At first, our goal was to create a multi-page website, much like this one, that would take the user onto completely different pages, but we could not figure out how to create new HTML files and link them.  To make our site more visually appealing, we chose a single image and spun the colors of that image around our whole site.  The title is created with two text-shadows.</p>  <div class="col-md-2"></div></div>

          <div>
        <p>The first part of our website is a short article on why our idea is important.  The top has a title banner that we created by putting an image in the background.  One issue that we wanted to fix was the unappealing spacing and alignment of the images, but we moved on in an effort to work on more important things.</p>  <div class="col-md-2"></div></div></div>

        <p>The second part of our website is a short article on how skin products pose a negative effect on the environment.  We added small touches like bolding specific words or phrases.  One big thing that we wanted to accomplish was to add a colored side border to the website, and this bordered our articles.</p>  <div class="col-md-2"></div></div></div>

        <p>Our skin survey, although unfinished and short, was our final goal in this project.  One main hurdle we faced that made finishing the survey so hard was the need for a form that handled user input.  We wanted to create a survey where users could answer questions about their skin to receive the best environmentally friendly products for their skin's needs.</p>  <div class="col-md-2"></div></div></div>

        <h2>October 2019</h2>
        <div class="scratchText" class="col-md-12">
          <p>At some points, developing our app felt like spreading perfectly softened butter on toast.  At other times, the development process was much like burnt toast, but I think every team will go through these kinds of moments throughout their development process.  For us, the tutorial code portion of the app was where we got tangled up in the most.  The instructions were clear to a good extent when reading through it, but when attempting to execute what is shown in the tutorial, we quickly ran into some problems, whether that was not finding a block, mistyping something when renaming components, or getting mixed up between the component names we chose compared to the ones shown in the tutorial.  However, once we got past this part of our development process, the rest was mainly built on our creativity and brainstorming ideas.  The feedback that we got towards the beginning of the project, although we were not completely done with our tutorial code yet, gave us another perspective on what people might want to see us play around with in Colored Dots.  Our ideas at the time were small and very “inside-the-box.”  However, talking with another group made us reassess our ideas, taking into account other ideas that were more bold, like creating sprites and stickers to go onto the canvas.</p>

          <p>Good communication was  crucial to making this project, especially since a lot of the time you’ll be working on programming is during the weekend, when you can’t see  your partner face to face.  I learned that nobody can read your mind and you have to be proactive and open with your partner by contacting them.  In our emails, we both assessed our current progress and told the other if we would have any free time to work on specific parts of the project.  Overall, I think we had great communication, which helped push our project to be the best it could be.  It was important that we were open to any ideas in the first stages of making this project, and I think that was what enabled us to do something really creative that, if asked at the very beginning of the project, we’d never thought we’d do.</p>
