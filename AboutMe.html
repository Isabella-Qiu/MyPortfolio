      <p>Hello!  Iâ€™m Isabella Qiu, a freshman at Dublin High School.  Currently, I am taking Computer Science Principles, which has opened my eyes to a world of what engineering can do for me and the people around me.  Hopefully, Computer Science Principles will be the start of a long path through the ups and downs of many engineering classes, and one day, a career in a STEM field.  
        <br><br>
      I have always wanted to go into the field of Computer Science, but even more so, I have always wanted a job that is versatile, constantly changing, and a job where I can interact with other people.  Now, I am ready and willing to work hard to get there.
        <br><br>
      In the years leading up to high school, I have found a passion in speech and debate.  Starting in the sixth grade, I auditioned to be on the middle school debate team, and after getting in, I knew that this was what I wanted to do for the next year and then again in eighth grade.  Being on a team of three, communication is indispensable.  My team and I have won numerous team and individual speaker awards in our time with the East Bay Debate League, but the experiences we have had as a team are immeasurable.  Many times, I was tested in a round where everything seemed out of reach and not in our favor, but it was only in those times where I was taught the value of teamwork, hard work, and determination.
        <br><br>
      Learning from the experiences I've had from being part of many groups, whether that is a sports team, an orchestra, a volunteer organization, or a debate team, and as I continue to involve myself in more groups, it has taught me the true meaning of phrases that we often find ourselves throwing around.  Phrases like "taking one for team" and "teamwork" constantly reappear in my day to day life as being the factors that tie myself with the people around me.  Without a deep understanding of these two concepts, I would have been unable to arrive where I am now, as someone with a solid grasp on compromise, dependability, and cooperation.
        <br><br>
      At my first Model UN conference, I was naturally in a state of bewilderment.  I love trying new things, and aside from the nervousness that afternoon, there was a rush of newfound adrenaline.  Being there at the conference put one thing into perspective for me, and that is the fact that we all had different values and beliefs, but we also all possessed a common goal of creating a solution that will benefit everyone.  We ended up deciding on our solution that day, after many hours of committee sessions and debate.  I have always wanted to lead a team, but only after being part of many teams did I understand that the line between a leader and a teammate is sometimes blurred.  We all have important things to add to the table, and we all must be willing to listen.
        <br></br>
      Now in high school, I want to set my focuses on hopes I have for the future, while still keeping in mind that my future starts with what I achieve today.  Being placed in Computer Science Principles this year is a precious opportunity, and I will do my best to not waste it.  I am looking forward to learning and expanding my skill set while in Computer Science Principles, then many times again in other engineering courses.
